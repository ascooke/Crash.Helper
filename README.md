<b>Increment/Decrement lives:</b> Adds and subtracts lives in increments of 1. Minimum 0 and maximum 999.

<b>Freeze lives:</b> When your lives counter changes it is reset back to the value it was at when you checked the box.

<b>Increment/Decrement masks:</b> Adds and subtracts masks in increments of 1. Does not visually update in game. If you have zero masks and add a mask you become invincible because of this.

<b>Infinite masks:</b> Keeps your masks frozen at 2. Does not prevent mask form. If you have zero masks, it does nothing, as to avoid the above invincibility bug.

<b>Maskform on hit:</b> Keeps your masks frozen at 4. This allows you to enter mask form by taking damage. Only available if infinite masks is also checked.

<b>Zero lives hotkey:</b> A hotkey that can be set and will set your life counter to zero. Useful for people with long load times so they can game over to reload a level rather than return to the hub and back.

<b>Increment mask hotkey:</b> A hotkey that can be set and will increment your mask counter up to a max of 2.
